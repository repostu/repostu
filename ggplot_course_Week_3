### Stuart Howard

## Exercise 1

The visualisation is a scatterplot to investigate the relationship between seniority and the number of bills introduced by the member to Congress.

The density of low numbers of introduced bills and levels of seniority mean there is clustering in the bottom left corner of the chart.

```{r exercise1,echo=FALSE}

cel_101 <- filter(cel, congress == 101)

ggplot(cel_101, aes(seniority, all_bills)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Seniority")+
  ylab("Bills Presented")+
  labs(title = "Bills presented by seniority : 101st Congress") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size= 4)) +
    annotate("text", x = 6, y =15, label = "there is great density here", color = "black") +
    annotate("rect", xmin = 2, xmax = 10, ymin = 13, ymax = 17, alpha = 0.1,  color = "purple") +
  #theme_wsj()
  theme_economist() 
  

```

## Exercise 2

The visualisation is a boxplot to investigate the effectiveness in the 101st Congress as distinct between Democratic and Republican party members.

The Volden and Wiseman legislative effective score (LES) is based on the higher values indicating that the member is more effective.

The Democratic Party held a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives but the President was the Republican, George H. W. Bush.


```{r exercise2,echo=FALSE}

cel_101$politics <-  recode(cel_101$dem, '0' = "Republican", '1' = "Democrat")

ggplot(cel_101, aes(x= politics, y = les)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlab("Political affiliation")+
  ylab("Legislative Effectiveness") +
  #facet_wrap(~politics) +
  labs(title = "LES in the 101st Congress") +
      annotate("text", x = 2, y =8, label = "despite the Bush administration", color = "black")  +
      annotate("text", x = 2, y =7, label = "it appears that the majority in the Senate and", color = "black") +
      annotate("text", x = 2, y =6, label = "House of Representatives means that Democratic", color = "black") +
      annotate("text", x = 2, y =5, label = "representatives can perform effectively", color = "black") +
      annotate("rect", xmin = 1.25, xmax = 2.75, ymin = 4, ymax = 9, alpha = 0.1,  color = "purple") +
    #xlab("Party Membership")+
  theme_wsj() 


```

## Exercise 3

The visualisations are facetted barplots designed to indicate the split of power by seniority and party membership in the 101st Congress.

The Democratic Party held a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives but the President was the Republican, George H. W. Bush.

```{r exercise3,echo=FALSE}




cel_101$power <-  recode(cel_101$power, '0' = "not on power committee", '1' = "on power committee")

cel_101$power <- as.factor(cel_101$power)

ggplot(cel_101, aes(x = seniority, y = congress/101, fill = politics)) + 
  geom_col() +
  xlab("Seniority (years) ") +
  ylab("Representative count and split")+
  labs(title = "Politics by Seniority and Power") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Political Party")) +
  #coord_flip() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') + 
  facet_wrap(~ power)




```

## Exercise 4

The visualisation incorporates 2 lineplots to indicate the increased presence of women as the Congresses came and went.

Over time, progress has been made in the greater representation of women but the gap remains significant.


```{r exercise4,echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}


cel$female <-  recode(cel$female, '0' = "Male", '1' = "Female")

cel$female <- as.factor(cel$female)

cel$Gender <- cel$female


cel %>%
  group_by(congress, Gender) %>%
  summarise(count= n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = congress, y = count, group =  Gender, colour = Gender)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
   theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    guides(colour = guide_legend(ncol = 1))+
   theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=rel(1))) +
       geom_text(aes(label = count, vjust = -0.2)) +
      theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "blue")) +
    scale_fill_hue(c = 180) +
  annotate("text", x = 94, y =204, label = "gap is 398", color = "black") +
    annotate("rect", xmin = 92, xmax = 96, ymin = 188, ymax = 220, alpha = 0.2,  color = "purple") +
    annotate("text", x = 114, y =204, label = "gap is 242", color = "green") +
      annotate("rect", xmin = 112, xmax = 116, ymin = 188, ymax = 220, alpha = 0.2,  color = "green") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(93,115,2)) +
     labs(x = "History of Congress by Number", y  = "Male/Female representation") +
        ggtitle("Gradual increase in representation of women at Congress" )
